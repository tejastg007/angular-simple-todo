# How to install project

- clone the repo
- install all node modules using : npm install
- start the json server using : npx json-server --watch db.json - this will create a endpoint on the port number 3000. If it's different then don't forget to change the port number in the service.ts file.
- run the project using : ng serve OR npm run start
- that's it.
